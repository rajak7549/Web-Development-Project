      <mark>lists of records (blocks) that are securely</mark> linked together
      via cryptographic hashes.<sup>.[1][2][3][4]</sup> Each block contains a
      cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction
      data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are
      represented by leaves). Since each block contains information about the
      previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data
      structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it.
      Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they
      are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively
      without altering all subsequent blocks.

      <br /><br />Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P)
      computer network for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes
      collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate
      new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable,
      since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure
      by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine
      fault tolerance.[5]

      <mark>Cryptographer David Chaum</mark>first proposed a blockchain-like
      protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established,
      Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups".<sup>[10]</sup>
      Further work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described
      in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.<sup>[4][11]</sup> They
      wanted to implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be
      tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated
      Merkle trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing
      several document certificates to be collected into one block.<sup
        >[4][12]</sup>
      Under their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been
      published in The New York Times every week since 1995.<sup>[13]</sup>
